# 👋 Hello, fellow humans!

I’m Matthew. I’m a front-end developer and engineering manager who’s pushed scripts, tags, and pixels for an array of nationally-adored brands, from Rice Krispies to Heinz, Herman Miller to Marvel.

These days, I run front-end engineering teams of all sizes and skillsets to produce snappy, accessible, and engaging words and widgets.

I’m a consummate tinkerer—many of my own repos are small tools, modules, and syntactic sugars. I’m having great fun publishing little [npm baubles](https://www.npmjs.com/org/afoot).

## Choice Vices

- **Coffee** ☕️ I owned a coffee house in the once-upon-a-time.
- **_Dungeons & Dragons_** 🎲 I moonlight as a DM for hire: [Dice Told Tales](https://www.dicetoldtales.com).
- **Running** 👟 Training for half-marathon distances!

## What's in a Name?

People ask what the username _niftinessafoot_ means. It's two words concatenated:

<dl>
<dt>niftiness</dt>
<dd>The state of being neat or clever. _nifty_ + _ness_ </dd>
<dt>afoot</dt>
<dd>happening or at-hand</dd>
<dl>

So in other words, _interesting things are here!_

In some places, I’ve started using the shorthand _afoot_, mostly because _niftiness_ was getting long and hard for people to type—including myself.
