# 👋 Hello, fellow humans!

I’m Matthew. I’m a front-end developer and engineering manager who’s pushed scripts, tags, and pixels for an array of nationally-adored brands, from Rice Krispies to Heinz, Herman Miller to Marvel.

These days, I run front-end engineering teams of all sizes and skillsets to produce snappy, accessible, and engaging words and widgets.

I’m a consummate tinkerer—many of my own repos are small tools, modules, and syntactic sugars. I’m having great fun publishing little [npm baubles](https://www.npmjs.com/org/afoot).

## Choice Vices
